# System Integration and Architecture Project
Objective:

Design, implement, and secure an integrated platform that enables a simulated enterprise environment to securely share data between a CRM system, an inventory management system, and a customer support application. This project emphasizes robust systems integration, secure data flow, and architectural best practices.

## **Overview**
The integrated platform facilitates seamless communication and data sharing between the following systems:  
- **CRM Service**: Manages customer information, including account creation, updates, and deletions.  
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks product inventory and availability.  
- **Support Service**: Handles customer support tickets and related operations.  

Each service operates as an independent microservice, and the API Gateway handles request routing, security, and traffic management.

*(Insert an architectural diagram showing how services interact via the API Gateway)*  

### **Key Features**
- Decoupled microservices for modularity and scalability.  
- API Gateway for request routing and central security management.  
- Secure data exchange using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).  
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates.

## **Services Description**

### **CRM Service**
- **Purpose**: Manage customer information and operations.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Create, update, delete customer accounts.  
  - Retrieve customer details.  

### **Inventory Service**
- **Purpose**: Manage product inventory and stock levels.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Add, update, and remove products.  
  - Retrieve product details and stock availability.  

### **Support Service**
- **Purpose**: Handle customer support tickets.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Create, view, and manage support tickets.  
  - Assign tickets to specific customers.  

---

## **API Gateway**
- **Purpose**: Acts as the single entry point for all client interactions.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - Route requests to appropriate services.  
  - Enforce authentication and authorization.  
  - Aggregate responses when necessary.  

### **Endpoints**
- `/api/customers` (CRUD operations on customers via CRM Service)  
- `/api/inventory` (CRUD operations on products via Inventory Service)  
- `/api/tickets` (CRUD operations on tickets via Support Service)  

---

## **Security and Authentication**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** implemented at the service and gateway levels.  
- **JWT Authentication** ensures secure communication between clients and services.  
- HTTPS for encrypted communication.  
- **Request Validation** to protect against malformed requests.  

---

## **Dependencies**
### **CRM Service**
```bash
cd crm-service
npm init -y
npm install express cors
npm install bcrypt
```
